Sorting an array means to arrange the elements in the array in a certain order. Various algorithms have been designed that sort the array using different methods. Some of these sorts are more useful than the others in certain situations.

**There are many ways by which the array can be sorted in ascending order, like:**

**1.Selection Sort:** The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.

 - The subarray which is already sorted. 
 - Remaining subarray which is
   unsorted.

In every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.

**2.Insertion Sort:** Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.

Characteristics of Insertion Sort:

-  This algorithm is one of the simplest algorithm with simple implementation
-  Basically, Insertion sort is efficient for small data values
-  Insertion sort is adaptive in nature, i.e. it is appropriate for data sets which are already partially sorted.

**3.Bubble Sort**: Bubble sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.
