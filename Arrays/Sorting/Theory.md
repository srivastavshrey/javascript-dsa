Sorting an array means to arrange the elements in the array in a certain order. Various algorithms have been designed that sort the array using different methods. Some of these sorts are more useful than the others in certain situations.

**There are many ways by which the array can be sorted in ascending order, like:**
**1.Selection Sort:** The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.

 - The subarray which is already sorted. 
 - Remaining subarray which is
   unsorted.

In every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.
